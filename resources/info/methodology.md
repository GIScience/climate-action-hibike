hiBike is currently composed of several indicators:
1. **Path Categories**: A categorisation of bikeable paths based on which other users share the path with cyclists
(such as pedestrians or motorised traffic).

2. **Dooring Risk**: Which streets are cyclists at elevated risk of being doored i.e. cycle in traffic next to parallel parked cars based on [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) data.

3. **Path Smoothness**: The surface smoothness of bikeable paths based on OSM data.

4. **Surface types**: The surface material of bikeable paths based on OSM data.

5. **Greenness (Optional)**: The greenness around bikeable paths

5. **Detour Factors (Optional)**: Highlights areas in which there is no bikeable infrastructure or in which cyclists need to take large detours. Based on OSM data and [openrouteservice](https://openrouteservice.org/) routing.

After computing hiBike for an area of interest and selecting one of the indicator results, the 'Description' page
includes further details about the indicator's data and methodology.

### Data

OSM is a free and open geo-database often called the "Wikipedia of maps".
It is a feature-rich collection of e.g. streets and paths maintained by voluntary contributors.
