hiWalk is currently composed of two core indicators:
1. **Path Categories**: A categorisation of bikeable paths based on which other users share the path with cyclists
(such as pedestrians or motorised traffic).

2. **Dooring Risk**: Which streets are cyclists at elevated risk of being doored i.e. cycle in traffic next to parallel parked cars.

3. **Path Smoothness**: The surface smoothness of bikeable paths.

4. **Surface types** The surface material of bikeable paths.

After computing hiBike for an area of interest and selecting one of the indicator results, the 'Description' page
includes further details about the indicator's data and methodology.

### Data

The indicators are based on the [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) database.
OSM is a free and open geo-database often called the "Wikipedia of maps".
It is a feature-rich collection of e.g. streets and paths maintained by voluntary contributors.
