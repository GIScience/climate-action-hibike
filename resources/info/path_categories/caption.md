**Who do I have to share this path with?**

This map presents a categorisation of bikeable paths based on whether they are only for cyclists or shared with pedestrians or motorized traffic. Paths that are designated for exclusive bicycle use are generally better in terms of safety and comfort while cycling, while the opposite is true when cyclists have to share the road with fast motorised traffic.

A full explanation of the individual categories can be found in the description below.
