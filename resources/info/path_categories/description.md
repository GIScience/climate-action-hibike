This map identifies bikeable paths and classifies them according to which other users share the path with cyclists. Cycling along paths that are designated for exclusive bikes is generally safer and more comfortable.

Categories, from best to worst:
* Designated exclusive: Designated cycle lanes structurally separated from the street, exclusively for cyclists.
* Designated shared with pedestrians: Cycle lanes that are structurally separated from the street but shared with pedestrians, typically either a common foot and bikeway, or footways where bikes are allowed to ride on.
* Shared with motorized traffic walking speed: Streets without a structurally separated cycle lane, with speed limits of roughly walking speed (<=15 km/h), such as living streets or service ways.
* Shared with motorized traffic low speed: Streets without a structurally separated cycle lane, with speed limits up to 30 km/h.
* Shared with motorized traffic medium speed: Streets without a structurally separated cycle lane, with speed limits up to 50 km/h.
* Shared with motorized traffic high speed: Streets without a structurally separated cycle lane, with speed limits up to 100 km/h.
* Requires dismounting: Paths where cyclists must dismount.
* Not bikeable: Paths where cycling is forbidden (e.g. tunnels, private or military streets) or streets without a structurally separated cycle lane and with speed limits higher than 100 km/h. Shown to explicitly highlight barriers.
* Unknown: Paths that do not fit in any of the above categories.

Data come from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and the categorisation is based on OSM tags.
