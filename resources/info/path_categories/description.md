This map identifies bikeable paths and classifies them according to which other users share the path with cyclists. Cycling along paths that are designated for exclusive bikes is generally safer and more comfortable.

Path categories that cyclists share with others, from best to worst:
* Bike Exclusive: Designated cycle lanes structurally separated from the street, exclusively for cyclists.
* Pedestrians: Cycle lanes that are structurally separated from the street but shared with pedestrians, typically either a common foot and bikeway, or footways where bikes are allowed to ride on.
* Cars Up to 15 Km/h: Streets without a structurally separated cycle lane, with speed limits of roughly walking speed (<=15 km/h), such as living streets or service ways.
* Cars Up to 30 Km/h: Streets without a structurally separated cycle lane, with speed limits up to 30 km/h.
* Cars Up to 50 Km/h: Streets without a structurally separated cycle lane, with speed limits up to 50 km/h.
* Cars Above 50 Km/h: Streets without a structurally separated cycle lane, with speed limits up to 100 km/h.
* Requires Dismounting: Paths where cyclists must dismount.
* Pedestrian Exclusive: Paths exclusively for pedestrians.
* Bike Not Allowed: Paths where cycling is prohibited.
* Unknown: Paths that do not fit in any of the above categories.

Data come from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and the categorisation is based on OSM tags.
