Cycling is much more joyful and less dangerous on smooth and well-maintained paths than on poorly maintained and bumpy, muddy, or slippery surfaces. Path smoothness is especially crucial for people with road or racing bikes, or families with children. This map categorises paths based on their smoothness.

Categories, from best to worst:
* Excellent: Paths with new and seamless surfaces, like fresh concrete or asphalt.
* Good: Paths with a smooth surface that shows the first signs of wear like small cracks or repaired surface imperfections, but are still usable with racing bikes.
* Intermediate: Either paved paths that show more signs of wear (like larger surface cracks and/or potholes), or the best quality unpaved roads.
* Bad: Paths which are heavily damaged paved roads or good but not pristine unpaved roads. A trekking bike might be required.
* Too Bumpy to Ride: Paths which are too bumpy to ride with a regular bike or are even impassable with any wheeled vehicle.
* Unknown: Paths for which there is no smoothness information.

Data come from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and the categorisation is based on OSM smoothness tags.
