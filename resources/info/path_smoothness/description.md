Explanation of the different smoothness categories from best to worst:
* Excellent: Paths  with new and seamless surfaces, like fresh concrete or asphalt.
* Good: Paths with a smooth surface that shows the first signs of wear like small cracks or repaired surface imperfections, but are still usable with racing bikes.
* Intermediate: Either paved paths that show more signs of wear (like larger surface cracks and/or potholes), or the best quality unpaved roads.
* Bad: Paths which are heavily damaged paved roads or good but not pristine unpaved roads. A trekking bike might be required.
* Too Bumpy to Ride: Paths which are too bumpy to ride with a regular bike or are even impassable with any wheeled vehicle.
* Unknown: Paths for which there is no smoothness information

Data come from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and the categorisation is based on OSM smoothness tags.
