How smooth is my path?
This map categorises paths based on their smoothness. Biking in very smooth paths is pleasant, while biking on paths categorised as 'too bumpy to ride' is hard, unpleasant, or even dangerous.

A full explanation of the individual categories can be found in the description below.
