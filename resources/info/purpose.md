The hiBike module provides a collection of indicators related to a number of different aspects that determine the perceived quality (safety, comfort, practicality) of cycling along a given street or within a given area of interest. In the future, the module will combine the different indicators into a general bikeability index.

Currently available are:

* A categorisation of bikeable paths based on which other road users share the path with cyclists (such as pedestrians and motorised traffic).
