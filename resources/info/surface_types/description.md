Detailed description of the surface types (in parts taken from the [OSMWiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:surface)):

* Asphalt: Short for asphalt concrete - mineral aggregate bound by asphalt
* Concrete: Portland cement concrete, forming a large surface, typically cast in place and may have predetermined breaking joints. Includes also the concrete plates and concrete lanes tags.
* Paving stones: A relatively smooth surface paved with artificial blocks (block pavers, bricks) or natural stones (specifically, flagstones), with a flat top. The gaps between individual paving stones are very narrow, either because the stones have a perfectly regular shape (rectangular, or any surface-filling shape) or because they have been carefully selected, fitted and placed in order to form an even, closed surface. Includes also paving stone lanes.
* Compacted: A mixture of larger (e.g., gravel) and smaller (e.g., sand) parts, compacted (e.g., with a roller), so the surface is more stable than loose gravel. Used, for example, for park paths, better tracks, some service ways. Best sort of ways below paving with asphalt, concrete, paving stones. Sometimes known as water-bound macadam. Mixture and compacting leads to more grip and stability.
* Fine gravel: This tag is used somewhat inconsistently. It may be used to specify fine loose gravel which makes it unsuitable for road bicycles, but it is also sometimes used as an alias for compacted, which is easy to cycle on.
* Gravel: This tag has very large meaning range. Used for cases ranging from huge gravel pieces like track ballast used as surface, through small pieces of gravel to compacted surface.
* Cobblestone: cobblestone is an unclear value, and was widely used for sett and actual cobblestone. Includes the sett and unhewn cobblestone tags.
* Paved (unspecified): A feature that is predominantly paved; a general description that gives no further information.
* Other paved surfaces: comprises the surface type tags of chipseal, grass paver, bricks, metal, metal grid, wood, stepping stones, rubber and tiles.
* Unpaved (unspecified): A feature that is predominantly unsealed (unpaved); i.e., it has a loose covering ranging from compacted stone chippings to soil.
* Other unpaved surfaces: comprises the surface type tags of shells, rock, pebblestone, ground, dirt, earth, grass, mud, sand, snow, woodchips, ice and salt.
* No data: no surface tag given.
* Other uncategorised surface type: surface tags that do not fall in any of the above categories.
