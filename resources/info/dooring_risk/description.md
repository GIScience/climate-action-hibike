Dooring, i.e. when a cyclist is hit by an opening door of a parked car, is a frequent and serious safety problem. This map displays paths' risk of dooring based on street-side parallel parking information:

- Safe route: Path without street-side parallel parking.
- Risk of dooring: Path with street-side parallel parking.
- Unknown: Path without parking information.

Data come from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and the categorisation is based on OSM parking tags and nearby road amenities.
